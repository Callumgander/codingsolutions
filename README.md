# codingsolutions
This is a repo for all of my solutions to coding problems.

All problems are usually taken from either codesignal, leetcode or hackerrank but some are done from outside sources, such as from books like Elements of Programming Interviews in Python.

I usually post a better solution done by someone else below mine in these files for reviewing purposes and to ensure I learn lessons from better solutions than mine. As such, parts of each file were not written by me and are marked as so.
