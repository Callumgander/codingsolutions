# codingsolutions
A repo for all of my solutions to coding problems

All problems are taken from either codesignal.com or hackerrank.com

I usually post a better solution done by someone else below mine in these files for reviewing purposes and to ensure I learn lessons from better solutions than mine. As such, parts of each file were not written by me and are marked as so
